## Develop and Demo

Build and package the plugin with...

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### To run integration tests - 
1.  You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed 
2.  The XL-Release image expects to find a valid XL-Release license on your machine, at this location: ~xl-licenses/xl-release-license.lic
3.  Open a terminal in the root of the xlr-cherwell-plugin project and run the test - 

```bash
./gradlew clean integrationTest
```
    
The test will set up a temporary xlr/mockserver testbed using docker. NOTE: The integration tests take about 5 minutes to run. 
1. The mock server is used to act as a stand-in for a Cherwell server. The mockserver will send Cherwell-like responses to XL Release requests.
2. After testing is complete, the test docker containers are stopped and removed. 

### To run demo or dev version (set up the docker containers and leave them running) -
1.  For requirements, see the 'To run integration tests' above
2.  Build the xlr-cherwell-plugin.jar - Open a terminal and cd into <xlr-cherwell-plugin code base> and run ./gradlew clean build . Be sure to re-run the command whenever code is changed. 
3.  From another terminal, cd into the <xlr-cherwell-plugin code base>/src/test/resources/docker/  directory. 
4.  Run (necessary the first time only): docker-compose build
5.  Then run: docker-compose up -d 
6.  XL Release will run on the [localhost port 15516](http://localhost:15516/). It may take up to a minute for XL Release to start up
7.  The XL Release username / password is admin / admin
8.  After XL Release has started, you can set up a template and shared configuration server by running the script <xlr-cherwell-plugin code base>/src/test/resources/docker/initialize/initialize_data.sh. Alternatively, follow the steps below:
    1.  within XL Release->Settings->Shared Configurations, configure a Cherwell Host with the following attributes:
        1.  Title -> Cherwell Server
        2.  Url -> http://mockserver:5000
        3.  Auth mode -> LDAP
        4.  Username -> USERNAME
        5.  Password -> PASSWORD
        6.  API Key -> API_KEY
    2.  Within XL Release, navigate to the Templates page and use the import feature to import the template located here: <xlr-cherwell-plugin code base>/src/test/resources/docker/initialize/data/release-template-cherwell.json .
9.  You can now run a release based the template named 'cherwell demo'.
10. When code is modified, re-run the ./gradlew clean build (in the first terminal), then refresh the testbed by running docker-compose down followed by docker-compose up -d (in the second terminal) and after XL Release starts up, re-import the server configuration and the template

Further Demo/Dev Notes:
1. The log file for the plugin - cherwell-plugin.log will be persisted to the local directory <xlr-selenim-plugin code base>/build/reports/tests/log directory. You may need to modify the log configuration (located in __init__.py) to DEBUG rather than INFO
2. The Mockserver runs on the [localhost port 5099](http://localhost:5099/)
3. The example mockserver Cherwell responses are located in the <xlr-cherwell-plugin code base>/src/test/resources/mockserver/responses directory
4. If you add example responses, be sure to rebuild the mockserver docker image
